# Keep Windows Awake
This is a simple Python script, designed to keep your Windows machine awake

## Idea behind developing this script is,
In office, for my development I usually use Linux desktop, where as Windows is main machine used for official email/communication purpose and all.
Every time I keep my Windows machine open, and work in Linux, it automatically turn-off the display and lock my Windows then after. It is very annoying to unlock it again and again typing big-long password. 
So I thought I will write this python script, which keep moving my mouse pointer for an interval of time and my screen will be always active as far as I manually lock it.
Clone it and Enjoy the script.
